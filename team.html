                <h4>Bio:</h4>
                <p> Abbey has danced all her life; she did tap, ballet, and jazz throughout elementary school and high school. But, it was when she came to MIT for CPW that she got her first taste of hip-hop. Abbey then took part in the Freshman Arts Program during pre-orientation and a Dance Troupe collabo during her first semester – and became hooked on hip-hop. She tried out for Ridonkulous in the spring of 2011 and made it onto the team! She has grown so much as a dancer over the past three semesters and cannot imagine her time at MIT without Ridonkulous. Abbey is honored to currently be the President and Co-Captain of such an awesome group of dedicated dancers and all-around amazing individuals.</p>

                <h4>Bio:</h4>
                <p>Andre never danced before coming to college, but was convinced by a certain similarly Afro'd, cookie-loving, longboard-riding Donk alum to try out DanceTroupe. After joining, he decided to improve at hip-hop dance and never looked back. He is now co-Social Chair of DT with Nicole and a brother of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. He has a tendency to dance ALL THE TIME, including while doing homework, in public places, and at dinner tables. His favorite styles of dance are femme and house. When he's not dancing (like never), he is studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science things. Andre believes that the most important thing he's learned from dance, aside from self-expression, is how to have confidence in his actions/movements.</p>

                <h4>Bio:</h4>
                <p>David never thought that he would dance in his life, but it has made all the difference for him at MIT. Coming from absolutely no dancing background, David tried out for the MIT Dance Troupe the spring of his freshman year and has since then fallen in love with the art of motion. The experience of embodying a choreographer’s vision in a piece has been invaluable; dance has challenged David to adore, hate, lust, let go, and everything else through movement. David cannot imagine where he would be if it were not for his dance family, and he will do all that he can to give back. Outside of dancing, David conducts spinal cord injury research in the Langer Labs at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and he volunteers in the Emergency Department at Massachusetts General Hospital. More than anything else, David values the relationships he has made with the people in his life. David hopes to attend medical school after college so that he may help underserved communities in developing countries.</p>

She loves how much both DT and Donk have supported her desire to grow as a dancer and as a creative individual. Honored to be DanceTroupe's Vice President and a member of Donk, Kathy knows that she'll be inspired by the amazing dancers around her and push herself to exponentially grow just as the past "baby donks" did. Outside of dance, Kathy majors in Applied Mathematics with minors in Biology and Management Science. She hopes to be able to apply her skills in an interdisciplinary field in the future. She also really loves photography and carries her camera to every possible event.</p>

                <p>Langston stands at about 6 foot and weighs in at around 160 pounds. A swimmer by nature since the age of 5, Langston started dancing since his freshman year in high school. Langston plans on majoring either in course 2 or course 6…he is not quite sure yet. He works hard: competing for the swim team, participating at his frat (Delta Upsilon!!!), and, of course, practicing for Ridonk! He loves eating and swimming and dancing and eating! He should graduate in June of 2016, and he thinks working for the government would be kind of cool (building the technology they use). Langston currently values many of his new Baby Donker memories like late night P-Setting in the student center and various shenanigans around campus. He also dabbles in photography (and by “dabbles” he means took one class in high school and still owns a camera). Also, he does not often write in the third person, but sometimes it amuses him.</p>

                <p>Maddie danced a lot as a kid - ballet, tap, jazz... but she never tried hip hop until she got to college. She also ran for 8 years, including 2 seasons on MIT's varsity track team. She joined MIT Dance Troupe as a freshman, doing a beginner's hip hop collabo. She fell in love with the style and has never looked back!  After her second season on the track team, Maddie decided to quit to take dance more seriously. Since then, she has had the amazing opportunities to become an officer and choreographer for DT, as well the honor of being selected to dance with Mocha Moves and Ridonkulous. She feels like she has found a family with MIT's dancers and she can't wait to keep improving and giving back to the teams! In her (minimal) free time outside of dance, Maddie is studying for a major in Civil Engineering with a minor in Architecture.</p>

As a senior, Natalie was captain and choreographer of the team, although her specialties were jazz and hick-kick. Then, after a freshman fall without dance at MIT, Natalie realized that she couldn't survive without any dance in her life so she joined Donk second semester. She is the only person crazy enough to be on Donk as well as MIT Varsity Crew. Natalie is also a tour guide as she enjoys showing her love for MIT and must somehow fund her unfortunately expensive Chobani addiction.</p>

            <p>Camille never danced before coming to MIT (well, other than parties/goofing around with friends), and she fell in love with hip-hop dance at the Activities Midway when she watched DT, Donk, and Mocha perform. Camille has danced in DT from then on and has choreographed since the spring of 2012, but she is currently taking a semester off from dancing in DT. She has danced in Mocha Moves since the spring of 2012, and this semester she is Assistant MoShoCaptain as well as one of the main choreographers. Camille is just so amazed at how much she has learned and grown so far, and she is really excited to be pushed even more by being on Donk. Camille cannot wait to be able to contribute to the group through choreographing and hopefully an exec position! Outside of dance, Camille studies Biology. She is preparing to attend medical school after MIT, possibly pursuing an MD/PhD joint degree. She might take a gap year in which she would most likely do MISTI-Chile again for 9 to 12 months. Camille conducts research in lymphoma metastasis in the Bhatia Lab of the Koch Institute, and she tutors General Chemistry and Intro Biology for the Office of Minority Education. Her favorite Donk memories so far are the reading room sesh after the first practice with fellow Baby Donkers and the galleria trip where she knocked over a Van’s shoe display. She also realized that David Han is hilarious, lol. Excited for more memories!!!</p>

            <h4>Bio:</h4>
            <p>Matt started dancing during the fall of 2011 when an overtly enthusiastic upperclassman coerced him – an impressionable freshman – to attend Dance Troupe auditions one weekend. Although Matt never saw himself as a dancer, he danced in two collabo dances that semester. His experience allowed him to forge great bonds with friends and to uncover an amazing release of stress at a stress-heavy school.  Dancing energizes a spirit of youth, energy, and passion that uncover the beauty of life, not only for a singular person but also – more importantly – for the group as a whole. During the fall of 2011, Matt began to watch Donk and Mocha as much as possible, aspiring to one day be a part of an even more committed group of dancers. Since the spring of 2012, Matt has found this opportunity in Donk and has grown tremendously as a person and dancer through the experience. When Matt is not dancing, he hangs out with his fraternity brothers at Phi Delts, plays a pickup game of soccer or basketball with some friends, or spends time the dance family that has made his time at MIT so special and so different than what he ever expected.</p>

            <h4>Bio:</h4>
            <p>The indescribable beauty of dance has impacted Mitali throughout her life. She began dancing (primarily hip-hop) in middle school through high school and always considered it, above all else, a form of pure artistic and personal expression. Music has always been an important part of her life, and dance was a manner of conducting/composing music through movement and life. Since Mitali began dancing at MIT, she has grown as a more self-aware dancer and as a choreographer with a fierce commitment to her teams and students. Nothing inspires her more than being a part of a remarkable team effort, a cooperative improvement, and a loving family that she has had the pleasure of knowing. Mitali currently investigates cancer cell metabolism in the Vander Heiden Lab in the Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer Research, and she hopes to attend medical school after her undergraduate studies. She holds her aspirations high, in both academics and dance, but will never let go of the gift of music and movement that have defined her life thus far.</p>

            <p>Sammy started dancing at the age of 3 and hasn't stopped since. She trained and competed with Hart Academy of Dance in La Habra, California in jazz, tap, ballet, contemporary, hip hop, and musical theater. Unwilling to give up dancing in college, she sought out every opportunity to dance when she came to MIT as a freshman. She has been a dancer and choreographer for Fixation, Dance Troupe, and Ridonkulous and continues on the latter two. The members of Ridonkulous have become a family to her and she cherishes the laughs, struggles, tears, and hard work that bond them together. "Dancing is the loftiest, the most moving, the most beautiful of the arts, because it is not mere translation or abstraction from life; it is life itself." -Havelock Ellis "For You, I sing I dance." -Phil Wickham</p>

            <p>Shannon is a nursing student at Northeastern but has decided to enter the brave new world of MIT hip hop in the Fall of 2013. She doesn't consider herself a hip hop dancer, as she has trained more in styles such as ballet, pointe, contemporary, jazz, modern, tap and African. But she also says she isn't a runner after having run a half marathon, so take her words with a grain of salt. She is honored to have been chosen to join the Donk family. She loves to push herself in every aspect of dancing and performing and is excited for all of the amazing experiences to come.</p>
